## Error handling

Non-2xx responses are reported on the response object, whatever the gateway
sends:

```php
$response = $api->getTransaction($id);

if ($response->failed()) {
    $error = $response->error();   // code, message, errors, instance
}
```

By default only `422` and `500` raise `ApiErrorException`. Set
`services.imoje.strict_errors` to `true` and every non-2xx raises it instead,
with `getCode()` carrying the real HTTP status.

The gateway answers errors in two shapes — most codes wrap the detail in an
`apiErrorResponse` envelope, `400` and `401` arrive bare — and both are read the
same way. A `401` carries no message at all, so the exception falls back to the
reason phrase.
